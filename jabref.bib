abstract = {The rise in technological advancements and Social Networking Sites (SNS) made people more engaged in their virtual lives. Research has revealed that people feel more comfortable posting their feelings, including suicidal thoughts, on SNS than discussing them through face-to-face settings due to the social stigma associated with mental health. This research study aims to develop a multi-class machine learning classifier for identifying suicidal risk levels in social media posts. The proposed Enhanced Feature Engineering Approach for Suicidal Risk Identification (EFASRI) is used to extract features from a novel dataset collected from Twitter and Reddit platforms. Three machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were employed for classification. The study demonstrates significant improvements in the precision, recall, and overall accuracy compared to previous research that used classical feature extraction mechanisms. The best-performing algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), achieved an overall accuracy of 96.33%. The findings imply that different features contain different levels of information, and the right combination of the features supplied to the machine learning algorithms may improve the prediction results.}

    abstract = {We developed linguistics-driven prediction models to estimate the risk of suicide. These models were generated from unstructured clinical notes taken from a national sample of U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) medical records. We created three matched cohorts: veterans who committed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not commit suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not commit suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a machine-learning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework. The resulting inference accuracy was consistently 65% or more. Our data therefore suggests that computerized text analytics can be applied to unstructured medical records to estimate the risk of suicide. The resulting system could allow clinicians to potentially screen seemingly healthy patients at the primary care level, and to continuously evaluate the suicide risk among psychiatric patients.},
